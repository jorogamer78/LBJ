1
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,397
Добро утро, дами и господа.

2
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,359
Боб Уокър от Далас Лав Фийлд

3
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,115
<i>...where a large crowd has gathered
to await the appearance...</i>

4
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,239
<i>...of President and Mrs.
John Fitzgerald Kennedy...</i>

5
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,791
<i>...who have arrived from
Carswell Air Force Base in Fort Worth.</i>

6
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,919
Lyndon, stop looking at that. Honestly.

7
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,631
Mr. Vice President,
we'll be in the third car, the gray Lincoln.

8
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,797
What's the word on Yarborough?

9
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,316
The president told the senator
he rides with you...

10
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,790
...or he could walk through downtown Dallas.

11
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,476
Oh, isn't that sweet? Thank you, honey.

12
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,030
- <i>Yes. Yes, it is the first lady.</i>
- Jackie!

13
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,559
<i>The youthful Mrs. Kennedy
looking beautiful in her pillbox hat...</i>

14
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,394
<i>...and matching pink outfit.</i>

15
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,398
<i>Mrs. Kennedy is followed by the president...</i>

16
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,950
- Hello. You look lovely.
- <i>... of the United States.</i>

17
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,270
Thank you so much.

18
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,750
- Hi, Jackie.
- Hi, Lady Bird. It's good to see you.

19
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,320
- Mr. President.
- Lyndon.

20
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,432
- How are you?
- Good.

21
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,432
Mrs. Johnson. Lovely as always.

22
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,034
- Lyndon.
- Hi, Nellie.

23
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,477
<i>Followed by Texas Senator Ralph Yarborough.</i>

24
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,710
Good morning to you.

25
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,878
This will be your vehicle, Mr. President.

26
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,039
<i>The crowd is jockeying
for a better look at the president.</i>

27
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,355
<i>Wait, no. The president has
walked past the motorcade...</i>

28
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,752
<i>...and he's making his way towards the crowd.</i>

29
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,476
- How are you?
- Hello.

30
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,155
- <i>Shaking hands with people.</i>
- Thanks for coming out.

31
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,198
- Thank you.
- <i>Some have cameras...</i>

32
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,273
- <i>... to capture this historic moment.</i>
- Thank you.

33
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,035
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Real pleasure.

34
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,876
<i>They didn't expect to be shaking hands
with the president of the United States.</i>

35
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,432
<i>This is quite a thrill for the people
who have waited here all morning.</i>

36
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,638
<i>And once the motorcade departs,
it will head through the city...</i>

37
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,077
<i>...where crowds are waiting for a view
of their president and his wife.</i>

38
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,272
- Thank you.
- <i>Thousands will be on hand...</i>

39
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,797
<i>...for that motorcade, which
will move through downtown Dallas.</i>

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,799
Don't you just love Texas?

41
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,035
Is there anywhere else you'd rather be?

42
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,352
This is regarding the Farm Bill.

43
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,115
We wanna vote in less than an hour.

44
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,636
Get back to the leader.
Tell him people are still undecided.

45
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,031
We wanna push this through
in the next half hour.

46
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,432
Because I'm not General Custer,
and this ain't Little fucking Bighorn.

47
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,080
So if you have any objections...

48
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,836
...tell me now before I head to the floor
of the United States Senate.

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,117
We got Cannon. Senator Yarborough.

50
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,710
- I'll be right with you.
- Senator Mansfield, sir.

51
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,271
- Mike. What's the number?
- About 48.

52
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,714
"About 48" is not a number.

53
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,792
Closest approximation I could get.

54
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,837
Mike, I want you to imagine...

55
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,357
...putting your little 2-inch pecker
on the edge of this table.

56
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,989
Now, I grab a hatchet, and I tell you...

57
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,836
...that I'm gonna swing it down
about 2 inches from the edge.

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,559
- Would you be nervous?
- Mm-hm.

59
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,919
Well, that's how I feel when you tell me
that the count is "about 48."

60
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,720
Now, what good is a whip
that doesn't know how to count?

61
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,191
Go back out there
and get me an actual number!

62
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,550
Juanita, dear?

63
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,439
- Yes, sir?
- Call Dirksen's office...

64
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,389
...and tell him I'd like to speak
to the senator at his earliest convenience.

65
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,758
- Yes, sir.
- George, get my tailor on the phone.

66
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,720
Who is Mike Taylor?

67
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,635
Who...? No, not "Mike Taylor." My tailor.

68
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,430
The guy who makes my fucking clothes.
Get him on the phone now.

69
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,559
- Senator Yarborough.
- Mr. Leader...

70
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,797
- ...I still don't take a drink.
- No?

71
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,398
Now if you've called me in here to ask me
about my vote on the Farm Bill...

72
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,991
...I should tell you I have not changed
my position in the slightest.

73
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,753
No problem. No problem at all.

74
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,360
But, listen, while I got you here,
there is one question...

75
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,557
...I've been meaning to ask you.

76
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,712
Have you got shit for brains?

77
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,029
What the hell is your problem
with this Farm Bill?

78
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,472
We should be doing a heck of a lot more
for the people who have less.

79
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,995
The only thing more irritating
than a liberal is a liberal from Texas.

80
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,355
The senator is here.

81
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,274
- Bring him in.
- What my constituents want is...

82
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,397
Your constituents are my constituents...

83
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,074
...and just because after three failed
attempts at the governor's mansion...

84
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,835
...you finally managed to win an election...

85
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,152
...hardly makes you an expert
on Texas voters.

86
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,551
- Sir?
- Don't tell me what they want.

87
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,552
Senator Dirksen is on the phone.

88
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,393
I've got your tailor as well.

89
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,156
You realize that Juanita managed to get
the minority leader of the Senate...

90
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,558
...quicker than you could locate
a man who sews for a living?

91
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,518
Hello, Everett, this is Lyndon.

92
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,357
We wanna bring this thing to the floor,
but can we do it without our two parties...

93
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,400
...nipping at each other
like a pack of rabid dogs?

94
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,150
Uh-huh.

95
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,875
Well, much appreciated, as always, senator.

96
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,190
- Juanita?
- Yes, sir?

97
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,431
Send Dirksen a box of Havanas.

98
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,150
Walter, get ready to move on it.
You know, this could be your lucky day.

99
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,040
You might be able to vote
your conscience on the Farm Bill.

100
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,113
I like to think that is the only way
that I ever vote.

101
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,910
Spoken like a true one-term senator.

102
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,360
Means why haven't you
endorsed me for president?

103
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,030
You haven't announced.

104
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,475
Beside the point.

105
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,439
- I like to hope that...
- You like Kennedy.

106
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,391
Senator Kennedy and I,
we share many principles.

107
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,315
You know, you got your show horses
and your workhorses.

108
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,439
Now, Kennedy's a show horse:
Easy on the eyes...

109
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,674
...but when you need your field plowed,
he won't leave the barn.

110
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,200
I hear you, but what is most important...

111
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,074
- ...to me...
- Hold that thought.

112
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,072
Hello there, this is Lyndon Johnson.

113
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,154
Now, you all made me
some real lightweight slacks...

114
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,437
...about three, four months ago.

115
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:02,510
Kind of a light brown and light green.
Rather, soft green and soft brown.

116
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,593
Like powder on a lady's...

117
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,158
...face, and now,
I'm what they call "well-endowed"...

118
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,716
...so you give me the average man's pants...

119
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:16,875
...I get all bunched up,
you know, like riding a wire fence.

120
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,756
So give me another couple of inches
from where my nuts hang down...

121
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,670
...round to the back of my bunghole.

122
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,951
All right. Thank you very much.

123
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,393
- You were saying?
- What is important to me...

124
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,871
- Sir, that just put us over the top.
- Call for unanimous consent.

125
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,077
Show horses, workhorses.

126
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,118
You only get one.

127
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,511
Go vote your conscience.

128
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,719
Nice of you to join us.

129
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,590
Well, I heard there was a seat available.

130
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,837
<i>And as the motorcade makes its departure...</i>

131
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,272
<i>...the presidential car is followed
by the Secret Service vehicle...</i>

132
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,717
<i>...which is followed by Vice President
and Mrs. Johnson.</i>

133
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,154
Oh. Heh.

134
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,994
No, I'm... I'm perfectly fine.

135
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,440
Guessing you Kennedys don't do
a lot of deer hunting.

136
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,600
Well, when Kennedys fire weapons,
it's usually at Nazis.

137
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,753
Lot of Nazis in Hyannis Port?

138
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,711
We need to know if you're running.

139
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,030
Quite comfortable in my post
as majority leader.

140
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,835
Then perhaps you'd consider
endorsing my brother?

141
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,311
I'll endorse whoever wins
our party's nomination.

142
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,200
And there's no chance
that'll be you, correct?

143
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,795
How many different ways
you want me to answer that?

144
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,912
One would suffice.

145
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:53,911
I have zero intention
of running for president.

146
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,200
I wanna know why you're
putting these signs up.

147
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,633
For starters, Johnson has not said
that he's running for president.

148
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,432
The reason I know is because I'm fucking him!

149
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,472
No, I'm not fucking him, I am him!

150
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,229
<i>His victory today was bolstered, in part...</i>

151
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,472
<i>...by the large Catholic presence
in Wisconsin.</i>

152
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,838
- <i>Up next, will be Illinois, New Jersey...</i>
- What?

153
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,032
Sir, I think it's time you announce.

154
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,113
<i>The next real test for Mr. Kennedy
will be in West Virginia...</i>

155
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,873
I haven't made up my mind yet.

156
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,032
Then tell me why I came all the way...

157
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,920
...from Texas to run a campaign
that doesn't have a candidate?

158
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,357
Well, John, I imagine, to bask
in the pleasure of my company.

159
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,112
Sir, I have been on the phone
all evening with delegates.

160
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,796
Every one of whom is for Kennedy today
and would be yours tomorrow...

161
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,795
- ...if you just announce you were running.
- A Catholic won in a Catholic state.

162
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,237
Big fucking deal. You think
he could do that in West Virginia?

163
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:59,280
This country is not gonna elect
a Catholic president.

164
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,352
He's starting to run away from the pack.

165
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:05,400
Nominations are not won
on the campaign trail.

166
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,120
They are won on the convention floor.

167
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,751
Bird, get me a drink, will you?

168
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,593
All right.

169
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,871
He better decide if he wants this.

170
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,509
He's never wanted anything more
in his whole life.

171
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,478
- He'll run.
- It'd be too late.

172
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,838
He's the best Senate majority leader
this country's ever had.

173
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,390
He works harder
than the other 99 senators combined.

174
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,120
He doesn't understand
why he's not the party's favorite.

175
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,915
He doesn't understand
why they don't just hand it to him.

176
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,278
Nobody gets handed the presidency.

177
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,511
Why won't he commit?

178
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,955
- That's complicated.
- He's afraid.

179
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,190
Of what?

180
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,512
Hell, every politician's afraid
people won't vote for him.

181
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,400
He's afraid people won't love him.

182
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,951
<i>All eyes are on West Virginia today...</i>

183
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,636
<i>...as voters cast their votes
in the state's primary election.</i>

184
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,916
<i>In a surprising upset...</i>

185
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,278
<i>...Senator John Kennedy has won
the West Virginia primary.</i>

186
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,953
<i>Many believed the issue
of his religion was insurmountable...</i>

187
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,158
<i>...but here is what Senator Kennedy
had to say about it:</i>

188
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,194
<i>I appreciate that question,
and I'll tell you when any man...</i>

189
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,513
<i>...stands on the steps of the Capitol
and takes the oath of office of president...</i>

190
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,879
<i>...he puts one hand on the Bible
and raises the other hand to God...</i>

191
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,437
<i>...as he takes his oath.
Now, if he... If he breaks his oath...</i>

192
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,719
I've never seen
a politician look that good on TV.

193
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,957
Oh, angel, he's not that handsome.

194
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,079
- <i>I, John Fitzgerald Kennedy...</i>
- I've never seen a movie star...

195
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,630
- ...look that good on TV.
- Heh, heh.

196
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,834
<i>...the office of president
of the United States...</i>

197
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,950
<i>...and will, to the best of my ability,
preserve, protect and defend...</i>

198
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,794
<i>...the Constitution of the United States,
so help me, God.</i>

199
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,317
Jesus, he just swore himself in.

200
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,392
<i>What's Jack got the rest haven't got?</i>

201
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,631
<i>The "matinee" face? The Kennedy name?</i>

202
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,196
<i>The Kennedy fortune...</i>

203
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,437
Lyndon, honey.

204
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,638
Do you want this?

205
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,110
Do you know why I married you?

206
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,956
I had other offers, but I chose you.

207
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,716
- Do you know why?
- I have no earthly idea.

208
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,200
Because you asked.

209
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,474
On our first date, when other boys...

210
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:46,634
...would be thinking about
how to steal a kiss...

211
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,795
...you asked me to marry you.

212
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,200
You didn't answer right away, though.

213
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,714
Well, it hit me like a whammy.

214
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,037
I'd only known you for about 20 minutes.

215
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,593
Ample time to fall in love with me.

216
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,314
Mmm.

217
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,760
When father first met you, he said:

218
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:13,995
"Daughter, you brought home a lot of boys.

219
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,639
This time, you brought home a man."

220
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,359
At least he liked me right away.

221
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,994
Angel, my point is...

222
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,876
...you knew what you wanted...

223
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,678
...and you got it.

224
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,597
And I couldn't have said "yes"
if you hadn't asked.

225
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,076
<i>Convention fever grips Los Angeles...</i>

226
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,674
<i>...where the Democrats convene.</i>

227
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,918
<i>Partisans of Senator Kennedy radiate
the cheer and confidence...</i>

228
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,357
<i>...of the powerful front-runner,
who is clearly the man to beat.</i>

229
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,513
<i>The only major threat to Kennedy's hopes
among the declared candidates...</i>

230
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,149
<i>...is Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson.</i>

231
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:14,111
The convention of the Democratic
Party of the United States...

232
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,511
...is now called in session.

233
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,431
<i>You need to go see the Wyoming delegates.</i>

234
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,116
Why the hell are we still fighting
over Western states?

235
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,114
Their delegates are meeting
with Kennedy right now.

236
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,078
Jack or Bobby?

237
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,038
Teddy, sir.

238
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,272
Christ, this place is infested.

239
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,789
"I have zero intention
of running for president"?

240
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,917
I had a change of heart.

241
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,680
Can't believe you'd look another man
in the eye and lie.

242
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,480
Next one of you who says
a disparaging thing about Jack's health...

243
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,359
...I'll personally knock his teeth out.

244
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:05,673
You said he's never felt better.
That wouldn't be a lie now, would it?

245
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,911
Balloting starts in two hours.

246
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,039
You don't take me down
in the first two rounds...

247
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,034
- ...I'm gonna beat you.
- There won't be a second round.

248
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,793
You seem awful confident.

249
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,917
I can count.

250
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:29,314
<i>They will receive the call
of the roll of state, of voting...</i>

251
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:34,191
<i>...for the nomination of president
of the United States.</i>

252
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,512
<i>Mr. Chairman, Wyoming's vote will make...</i>

253
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,230
<i>...a majority for Senator Kennedy.</i>

254
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,030
<i>Can we get the vote from Wyoming?</i>

255
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:09,638
First-round knockout, boys.
Just like Rocky Marciano.

256
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,029
<i>The Times</i> wants a comment.

257
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,312
Tell them there's a new heavyweight
champion. His name is Kennedy.

258
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,995
- How's the acceptance speech coming?
- Easiest speech I've ever had to write.

259
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,716
Bobby, we're getting 20 calls a minute
about the VP. Everyone wants a name.

260
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,712
First, we have to pick a name.

261
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,398
Hello?

262
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,799
Lyndon.

263
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,272
Lyndon, honey, wake up.

264
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,437
- Wake up.
- What's the matter, Bird?

265
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,637
It's John Kennedy.

266
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,916
This is Lyndon Johnson.

267
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:00,673
Walter, order a fresh pot of coffee,
please. I have to get dressed.

268
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,274
Yes, ma'am.

269
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:07,231
Oh, yes. Yes, honey,
the red tie is so much better.

270
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,471
Thanks, sweetheart.

271
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,277
- Love... Yeah, just fix it now a little.
- Yep.

272
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,116
- Okay?
- Yep.

273
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,950
- Lyndon.
- Hi, Jack. Come on in.

274
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,994
Thank you.

275
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:44,151
Make sure Symington, Humphrey
and Stevenson are all near their phones.

276
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,516
We'll make our choice today.

277
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,909
What's wrong?

278
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,356
You're not gonna believe
where your brother is.

279
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,273
Lyndon, you have more experience
and more talent, more wisdom.

280
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,912
Unfortunately, this is politics,
and none of that matters.

281
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,595
The better man won.

282
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,160
I'm not better.

283
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,353
Better-looking, maybe.

284
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,474
Yeah, if I had some of those Kennedy genes...

285
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,235
...I might've got some
of the Kennedy delegates.

286
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,272
I think the press was too hard on you.

287
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,558
Well, I could walk
on the Potomac River, and next day...

288
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,872
...the headlines would read:
"Johnson can't swim."

289
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,760
You mind if I ask you a question, Lyndon?

290
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,194
<i>You're out of your mind, Jack!</i>

291
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,192
You couldn't have made a worse choice
if you tried.

292
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,158
- I spoke with Dad. He agreed.
- Spoke with Dad?

293
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,438
- If we wanna win, we need Johnson.
- Why didn't you consult with me?

294
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,637
We also agreed we'd never
convince you it was a good idea.

295
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,200
Maybe because it isn't.

296
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,556
Johnson and his men spent
the last 72 hours...

297
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,110
...trying to convince the entire delegation
you have Addison's disease.

298
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,396
I do have Addison's disease.

299
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,592
- That's not the point.
- Labor hates him.

300
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,956
Civil rights leaders hate him.
Liberals hate him.

301
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,558
Kenny, we will win the liberal vote anyway.
We need Southerners. We need Texas.

302
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,360
The only person Johnson will
ever be loyal to is Johnson.

303
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:03,718
Bobby, I'd rather him serve
under me as vice president...

304
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,351
...than fight for control of the government
as leader of the Senate.

305
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,035
We can't be the only ones
who think this is a bad idea.

306
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,671
Well, as it turns out, you might not be
because he hasn't accepted it yet.

307
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,995
George, look into this, will you?

308
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,753
Yes, sir.

309
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,199
Yeah. Hello there. Is majority leader here?

310
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,033
- Sir?
- Gentlemen...

311
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,556
...can you give us a minute?

312
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,039
Listen, I...

313
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,795
I think you should decline the offer.

314
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:46,233
Say it was an honor to be considered,
but your duty is to the Senate.

315
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:51,032
I think we could have a much more
effective partnership with you...

316
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,795
...in your role as majority leader.

317
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,435
Is this what your brother thinks?

318
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,593
Do you really want this job?
It's too small for you.

319
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,315
Did Senator Kennedy ask you
to relay this message?

320
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,392
No, sir, I am here on my own.

321
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:08,793
Okay, well,
I will take that tidbit of wisdom...

322
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,077
...under advisement.

323
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,357
Thank you, Bobby.

324
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,120
- What'd he want?
- What do you think he wanted?

325
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,475
He may be right.

326
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,997
If you run with Kennedy and lose,
you're giving up your Senate seat too.

327
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,879
- No, he won't.
- What do you mean?

328
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,514
He can run for both offices.

329
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,478
Not at the same time.

330
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,552
- We changed the law.
- When?

331
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,960
- When I asked them to.
- I have that number for you, sir.

332
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,237
- What'd you find out?
- Ten of 36.

333
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,596
Okay, talk to me.

334
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,513
It's a thankless job.

335
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:58,833
Yeah, well, so is being school teacher
in Blanco County, Texas.

336
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,957
Ten of 36?

337
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,157
Of the 36 men who have been vice president...

338
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,592
...10 have gone on to become president.

339
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:11,312
Kennedy loses, the majority leader will be
the most powerful Democrat in the country.

340
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,437
Kennedy wins,
the majority leader will still be...

341
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,160
...the most powerful Democrat in Congress.

342
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,119
There's just no power in the vice presidency.

343
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,993
Walter, how long you been with me?

344
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,554
Twenty-one years.

345
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:34,397
And in 21 years, can you think of a time
that I have taken over a new office...

346
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,594
...and not made it 100 times
more powerful than when I got there?

347
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,116
No, sir.

348
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,997
Power is where power goes.

349
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,829
Should be at the Trade Mart in 15.

350
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,998
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

351
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,675
- Yes, sir.
- They love him.

352
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,071
They believe in him.

353
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,960
They know the president's civil rights law...

354
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,077
...is gonna change everything.

355
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,631
The president doesn't have
a civil rights law.

356
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,757
He has a civil rights bill.

357
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,435
I have faith in my heart.

358
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,320
And shit for brains.

359
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,871
<i>Kennedy has been elected president...</i>

360
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:38,278
<i>...by one of the smallest margins
in electoral history...</i>

361
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,716
<i>...with nearly 70 million votes cast.</i>

362
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,230
<i>The president-elect defeated Richard Nixon...</i>

363
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,915
<i>...by approximately 112,000 votes.</i>

364
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,156
<i>The new vice president, Lyndon Johnson...</i>

365
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,870
<i>...fought hard in his home state of Texas
to deliver the White House...</i>

366
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,192
<i>...for the 35th president
of the United States:</i>

367
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,840
<i>John Fitzgerald Kennedy.</i>

368
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,710
<i>And from earlier today,
here is President John F. Kennedy...</i>

369
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,236
<i>...delivering his inaugural address.</i>

370
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:09,913
<i>All this will not be finished
in the first 100 days.</i>

371
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,756
<i>Nor will it be finished
in the first 1000 days.</i>

372
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,752
- After we unpack...
- <i>Nor in the life...</i>

373
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,594
- ...what is first on the agenda?
- <i>... of this administration.</i>

374
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:23,312
<i>Nor even perhaps in our lifetime
on this planet.</i>

375
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,392
<i>But let us begin.</i>

376
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,476
- Juanita, dear?
- Yes, sir?

377
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,960
I wanna write a letter.

378
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,911
"I hereby request
that the State Department...

379
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,278
...the Defense Department
and the Central Intelligence Agency...

380
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,432
...cooperate fully with the vice president."

381
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,960
Lyndon did not write that.

382
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,079
- That's his signature right there.
- Ha, ha, ha.

383
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:46,677
Oh, what, NASA too? He even requested
oversight of the space program?

384
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,116
Wants control of everything
from here to the moon.

385
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,755
I say we send it
to <i>The Washington Post,</i> right?

386
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,559
Publish it. Humiliate the bastard.

387
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,794
Last month, Johnson was the most
powerful Democrat in all of Washington.

388
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,476
Now he answers to my kid brother
and his Harvard roommate.

389
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,360
Nobody's gonna do anything
to embarrass my vice president.

390
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,751
- He embarrasses himself.
- Started calling himself LBJ...

391
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,759
...after FDR was elected.
Thought it sounded more presidential.

392
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,957
Well, he's no FDR, and he's no JFK.

393
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,113
He's Lyndon "I'll never be president
in a million years" Johnson.

394
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,557
I'm aware of your feelings. That's why
I'm putting Kenny in charge of him.

395
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,920
What?

396
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,754
Congratulations, Kenny. You're
my new liaison to the vice president.

397
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,880
I'm sorry, am I being punished for something?

398
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,430
He's a sensitive man with an enormous ego.

399
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,359
Your job is to placate him.

400
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,480
Now, I don't care if you have to kiss
his ass all over town in order to do it.

401
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,757
I can't have him causing problems for me.

402
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:46,199
I'm sure we can find something
to keep him occupied.

403
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,273
What the fuck is the PCEEO?

404
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,036
It's the "President's Committee
on Equal Employment Opportunity."

405
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,795
The president wants to ensure
all government agencies...

406
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:00,318
...and contractors exercise
fair hiring practices with regards to race.

407
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,836
It's his first major initiative
in civil rights.

408
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,117
Our Southern Democrats are gonna hate this.

409
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,717
No shit, and when this
trumped-up committee inevitably...

410
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,840
...fails to address
this country's civil rights problems...

411
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,674
...well, the rest of the Democrats
are gonna hate that.

412
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,516
So why the fuck am I busy alienating...

413
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:25,436
...every son of a bitch in my party when...

414
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,117
...if I'm gonna make a run in '68...

415
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,557
...well, I'm gonna need people
to fucking like me!

416
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,676
Shut the door.

417
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,635
- How could anybody not like him?
- Heh, heh, heh.

418
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,717
I had an idea.

419
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,671
Yeah, you know, when I was 13 years old...

420
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,596
...I was driving home with my daddy,
and I made some smart-ass comment...

421
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,831
...pissed him off,
he slammed on the brakes...

422
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,674
...tossed me out the truck,
told me I was walking home.

423
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,959
Well, it was hot as Hades,
six, seven miles to go...

424
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:13,070
...so I was feeling real bad for myself...

425
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:19,430
...when I look up, and I see
this old Chevy kicking up dust.

426
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,917
Pulls to a stop in front of me,
and this beautiful woman...

427
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:29,316
...with curly red hair, leans out
the window, smiles and says:

428
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,796
"Need a ride, son?"

429
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,193
Oh, yeah.

430
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,996
She had the biggest titties I ever saw...

431
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:42,758
...and I stared at them the whole ride home.

432
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:46,917
And I never would have seen them
if my daddy hadn't...

433
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,634
...punished me to begin with.

434
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,192
So, what are you saying?

435
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,920
When life gives you lemons,
you make lemonade?

436
00:26:55,680 --> 00:27:01,039
No, George, I'm saying, sometimes,
you think the Lord is giving you lemons...

437
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,432
...and, in fact, he's giving you
big, beautiful titties.

438
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,595
So there's an upside to you being
appointed chairman to this committee?

439
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:12,800
Well, this damn civil rights issue is
gonna tear the Democrats in two.

440
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,590
We got rival camps
that are never gonna see eye to eye.

441
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,912
But as long as they're sitting
at the table...

442
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,754
...they're gonna need an interpreter.

443
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:27,073
And Kennedys don't speak Southern.
Southerners don't speak Kennedy.

444
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,995
I'm the only man who's fluent
in both languages.

445
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,389
Which side are you on?

446
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,392
You're missing the point.

447
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:39,840
As long as neither side declares
all-out war, both sides need me.

448
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,950
The best thing that can happen for me is
this civil rights debate goes on forever.

449
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,112
And how do we make that happen, sir?

450
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,837
Compromise, boys.

451
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,669
Endless compromise.

452
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:57,359
So chairman of the Equal
Employment Opportunities Committee.

453
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,352
Boy, those Kennedys must really hate you.

454
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,000
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Yeah, yeah.

455
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,159
- I drew the short straw on this one.
- I wouldn't worry about it.

456
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,994
I don't imagine that committee's
gonna be around very long.

457
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,236
Don't be so sure.

458
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,072
Never underestimate Southern delegation.

459
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:14,119
My army may be small,
but our cause is mighty.

460
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:18,433
Am I talking to Senator Richard Russell
or General Stonewall Jackson?

461
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,957
No, you're talking to the man
who defeated three presidents on this.

462
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,554
I'll defeat a fourth.

463
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,436
What did Abe Lincoln say
after he woke up from a three-day drunk?

464
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,632
- I don't know.
- "I freed the what?"

465
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,315
- Thank you, Eddie.
- Yeah, thank you, Eddie.

466
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,280
Now...

467
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,994
...government has a $1 billion contract
to build a new plane.

468
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,277
I know exactly where that contract should go.

469
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,477
I bet you do, and I want nothing more...

470
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,599
...than to see that Lockheed plant
in Georgia get this contract.

471
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,276
Glad to hear it. You convince that
committee of yours to go along with it.

472
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,955
I will. I will.

473
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:58,558
After you convince Lockheed
to make some changes at the plant.

474
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,154
Not making any changes.

475
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,797
Why don't those Kennedys
just leave these niggers alone?

476
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,520
- They were happy.
- Come on, Dick.

477
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:16,038
I can't have signs all over the plant
saying "colored" this and "white" that.

478
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,635
Now you don't like
separate drinking fountains?

479
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,952
Oh, Lord. All right, fine.
I'll bring in paper cups.

480
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,430
I'm not saying
that you're not right about this...

481
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:28,640
...but you need to do
a little bit more on this one.

482
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,110
You're gonna have to hire some nigras.

483
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,752
Well, who do you think mops the floors?

484
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,389
I'm not talking about janitors.

485
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:40,918
I'm talking about engineers, skilled labor.

486
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,434
Show me a skilled one first.

487
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,478
Government's got no business
telling employers who they should hire.

488
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:50,390
It's the government's billion dollars.
I'm guessing we got some right.

489
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,796
Forced hiring's a stone's throw away
from forced labor.

490
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,317
- Last I heard, we were against that here.
- You don't have to convince me.

491
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,989
I'm the one going 15 rounds
with the Kennedys on this.

492
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,038
Those Harvard boys not gonna tell us...

493
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,352
- ...how to run the state of Georgia.
- Of course not.

494
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:08,719
But the Kennedy did get elected
by appealing to the colored man.

495
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,839
Now, if we play this right,
we're gonna have those nigras...

496
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,231
...voting Democrat the next 200 years.

497
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,392
You want me to surrender? What are you doing?

498
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:20,713
No. I am asking you... I'm begging you...

499
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:25,790
...to give these Kennedys
a little something just to quiet them down.

500
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:29,317
It ain't gonna make any difference,
but if we don't move at all...

501
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,200
...their allies are gonna line up
against us...

502
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:36,354
...and there's gonna be no way to put
the brake on all sorts of wild legislation.

503
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:40,634
- It'll be Reconstruction all over again.
- Well, let them try. Just let them try.

504
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,520
I'll use every means at my disposal
to defend this cause...

505
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,070
...till the last breath of air
escapes my lungs.

506
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,078
Keep the air in your lungs, Dick.

507
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,079
I'm... I'm gonna get you what you want...

508
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:55,274
...but just help me out a little bit here.

509
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,074
<i>Since the 1954 Supreme Court Ruling...</i>

510
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,755
<i>...in</i> Brown v. the Board of Education...

511
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:07,476
<i>...the issue of civil rights has
taken hold throughout the nation.</i>

512
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,720
<i>Last year, in Greensboro, North Carolina...</i>

513
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,272
<i>...four negro college students staged
a sit-in at a whites-only lunch counter...</i>

514
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,071
<i>...sparking a wave of similar
demonstrations in other states.</i>

515
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,599
<i>And earlier this spring...</i>

516
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,558
<i>...a group known as the Freedom Riders...</i>

517
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,030
<i>...began their voyage throughout the South.</i>

518
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,080
<i>They have been met by cameras
and, at times, by mobs.</i>

519
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,837
<i>This week in Jackson, Mississippi...</i>

520
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,471
<i>...highway patrol officers
and national guardsmen kept the peace.</i>

521
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,915
<i>But this much is clear:</i>

522
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,476
<i>The cause of integration is a national issue.</i>

523
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,356
- Sir.
- Sir.

524
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,395
Please take your seats.

525
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:02,357
By presidential order, this committee
on equal-employment opportunity...

526
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,394
...is to be comprised of:

527
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,471
"Four members of the cabinet...

528
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,758
...four heads of agencies and secretaries...

529
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,879
...the Army, Navy and Air Force."

530
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,510
Out of curiosity, who the hell are all you?

531
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,917
We got the undersecretary of state,
the undersecretary of defense.

532
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,037
We got Nick Katzenbach. What's the matter?

533
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,750
Bobby Kennedy too busy to join us today?

534
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,912
Sir, the attorney general had a previous...

535
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,959
Despite the fact that none
of your bosses are here...

536
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:43,878
...there is one person on this long list
that did, in fact, show up.

537
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:47,590
And it is the vice president.
So let's get this thing started.

538
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,876
First order of business,
$1 billion contract...

539
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,271
...to build a new transport airplane.

540
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,797
Senator Russell seems to think
the contract is going to Georgia.

541
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,593
That's because it is.

542
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,800
That Lockheed plant's record
on civil rights is disgraceful.

543
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,075
How old are you?

544
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,559
- Thirty-two. Sir.
- Mm.

545
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,640
Richard Russell is the leader
of the Southern Democratic Caucus...

546
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,440
...and chairman
of the Armed Services Committee.

547
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,439
We are gonna work
with Senator Russell on this.

548
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:31,195
Better to have him inside the tent
pissing out than outside pissing in.

549
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,710
Sir, I know I speak for my boss when I say...

550
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,759
...that this is a fight
in which we should not give an inch.

551
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:40,596
The secretary of labor's drafted a list of
demands that he would like addressed...

552
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,195
...before we award the contract to any plant.

553
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,955
We need to use this opportunity
to demonstrate the full power...

554
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,554
...of this committee.

555
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,600
If your boss wants to make demands,
tell him to deliver them to me in person.

556
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,313
And, son,
if this committee had any real power...

557
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,713
...the man you work for would be sitting
at this table instead of you.

558
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,793
This meeting is adjourned.

559
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,950
Mr. President, over here!

560
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,073
Get down. Get down! Go, go, go!

561
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,553
I'm switching to Charlie frequency.

562
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,120
Stay with him.

563
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,312
Stay down, stay down! Go, go, go!

564
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,000
- Good morning, Mrs. Lincoln.
- Good morning, Mr. Kennedy.

565
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,356
- Mr. Bobby.
- Hi, Caroline. How are you?

566
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,749
Here you go.

567
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,320
- Hi, Caroline.
- Come on, hon.

568
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,630
Good morning, Lyndon.

569
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,157
- Oh, hello, Mr. President.
- Sorry to keep you waiting.

570
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,551
- How you getting along?
- Busy morning.

571
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,637
How are we doing on this committee?

572
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,950
Fine, Mr. President.

573
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:55,159
Need to make sure
that this Lockheed contract conforms...

574
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,551
- ...to the committee's purpose.
- Well, ahem...

575
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,155
...Senator Russell has assured me that...

576
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,109
...we can expect to see
some significant changes in that plant.

577
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,079
That's not what I hear.

578
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,791
If you're concerned,
you should come to one of our meetings.

579
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,191
If you'd like me
to express my dissatisfaction...

580
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,234
...in front of the entire committee,
that could be arranged.

581
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,750
Lyndon, we're not awarding
a government contract...

582
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,877
...to a plant that violates civil rights.

583
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,431
And you might remind Senator Russell
that we don't need his help on this.

584
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,559
We've got a Lockheed plant
in California happy to build planes.

585
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:31,350
With all due respect,
if you take that contract from Russell...

586
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,115
...all it will show is
that you can't make him do...

587
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,431
...one damn thing that he doesn't wanna do.

588
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,518
Now, you have to understand his thinking.

589
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,115
It's straight out of the last century.

590
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,920
He's never gonna be a progressive like us.

591
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,954
Why should we be working
with him on this, then?

592
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,760
Because you don't wanna make
an enemy of Richard Russell.

593
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,630
He'll put the brakes on every legislation
we're trying to move through Congress.

594
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,474
We're not gonna let
one senator hold us hostage.

595
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,919
I suggest you don't wanna find out
how powerful that one senator can be.

596
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:08,630
I need this committee to show
a strong record right from the start.

597
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,358
Something that demonstrates
concrete changes on civil rights.

598
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:16,275
We can't do that if we're giving
a huge contract to a discriminatory plant.

599
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,160
On the contrary, I think we can, sir.

600
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:23,230
If we send that contract to Georgia...

601
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:27,838
...then I can get Russell to make
that plant hire a number of negros.

602
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,959
And then, we can have
white men and black men...

603
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,874
...working side by side in the deep South...

604
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,760
...building America's newest airplane.

605
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:41,597
This can be one hell of a victory
for this administration.

606
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,437
All right, Lyndon, but...

607
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,678
...you're gonna have to move Russell.

608
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,830
Thank you, Mr. President.

609
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:59,432
Oh, and if I may, there's just
one other item I'd like to discuss.

610
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,240
What's happening with Sarah Hughes?

611
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,834
The judge from Dallas?

612
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,197
You haven't responded
to my recommendation to nominate her.

613
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,955
It's not your place
to make that recommendation.

614
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,351
She'd make a damn fine judge.

615
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,712
- She's too old.
- To you, everybody's too old.

616
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,950
Senators make those recommendations.
You know that.

617
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:26,352
I promised Sarah Hughes that appointment.

618
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,910
It's Ralph Yarborough's
recommendation to make.

619
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:34,239
How's it gonna look to my state
if I can't get a federal judge appointed?

620
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,189
I understand your frustration, Lyndon,
but this is how it's gotta be done.

621
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:41,990
We'll give Sarah Hughes a look
next time. Thanks for stopping by.

622
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,435
She'll be ready to take off this summer.

623
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,472
Record time.

624
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,396
Are you sure that big bitch will fly?

625
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,672
She'll fly all right.
Built by Georgia's finest.

626
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,513
Half of them, anyway.

627
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,789
Thanks to you.

628
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,040
Jesus, Lyndon. God, put that thing away.

629
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,797
Look at that. Number-two man in Washington.

630
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,191
Attorney generals don't become president.

631
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:22,673
There's a lot of things these Kennedy
boys do that no one else has done.

632
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,917
He is a nice-looking boy.

633
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,719
You know, I've been...

634
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:35,271
...hearing disturbing news about
some goddamn civil rights bill.

635
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,595
Yeah.

636
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,992
Yeah, I'm afraid
I've been hearing the same thing.

637
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,595
I hope you're impressing on the president
the severity of the moment.

638
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:48,118
Well, I have, but, unfortunately,
he doesn't answer to me or you.

639
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,640
Mmm.

640
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:54,639
So Kennedy won the presidency
by a fraction of a percent.

641
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,554
Do you recall my margin of victory
that very same year? Ha-ha-ha.

642
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,112
Mmm. Hang on, Dick.

643
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,436
- Yeah, I believe you were unopposed.
- That's right. I was. Unopposed.

644
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,592
Six years before that too.

645
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,269
And six years before that. And you know what?

646
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,431
Six years before that.
Are you plodding toward a point?

647
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,552
I may not be president, but neither
am I ever in jeopardy of losing my job.

648
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:23,034
So if the president sends
a civil rights bill to Congress...

649
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:27,035
...it'll be my distinct pleasure
to see it die a painful death.

650
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,556
And I'll kill every other bill along the way.

651
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,996
I don't care
if it costs my party the White House.

652
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:36,672
I'm sure we can all sit down and come
to an agreement that we can all live with.

653
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:40,390
It seems like every time we do that,
I'm the only one giving something up.

654
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,439
And I'm about running out of things
that I can live without.

655
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:48,117
Dick, you didn't have to give up
your billion-dollar airplane, did you?

656
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:53,756
I'm not saying lay down and die,
but this train is leaving the station.

657
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,516
So you can stand there
and watch it roll on by...

658
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:01,794
...or you can hop on it with me
and try to slow the damn thing down.

659
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,680
Yeah.

660
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,792
Move, move, move!

661
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:19,996
Stay back! Stay back.

662
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,351
We're not stopping for anything, understand?

663
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,955
- You bet, partner. You ready, Bird?
- Here we go.

664
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,918
- Let's move.
- Everybody back!

665
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,440
Everyone back.

666
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,795
Keep that area clear.

667
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,031
Keep the area clear!

668
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,599
- What's going on?
- Move!

669
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,518
We're going right through
this door right here, sir. Here we go.

670
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,476
Copy that.

671
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,114
Get them out of here.

672
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,511
- Back in the corner. Here we go.
- Sorry?

673
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,716
Here you go.

674
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,830
Nobody comes in unless he's got
a damn good reason to be here.

675
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,879
- He wants you to call Washington.
- I'm not leaving this man.

676
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:57,033
The president and Governor Connally
suffered gunshot wounds.

677
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:00,312
I don't know the governor's condition,
but the president...

678
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,630
It's bad.

679
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,870
We need to get you to Washington
as soon as possible.

680
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,480
I'm not leaving here.

681
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,919
Mr. Vice President, safest place
for you is the White House.

682
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:13,596
It would be unthinkable for me
to leave President Kennedy...

683
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,235
...while he fights for his life.

684
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,040
Gentlemen...

685
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,352
...this is a time for prayer
if ever there was one.

686
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,390
<i>In another current trouble spot:</i>

687
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,119
<i>Plaquemine, Louisiana.</i>

688
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,198
<i>Mounted state troopers and police...</i>

689
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:40,080
<i>...used tear gas
and high-pressure water hoses...</i>

690
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:43,557
<i>...in Plaquemine last night to break up
a civil rights demonstration...</i>

691
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,871
<i>...that almost erupted into a race riot.</i>

692
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:50,040
How many more demonstrations do we
have to look at with hoses and dogs?

693
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,715
I'm running out of ways
to explain to the press corps...

694
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,434
...why the civil rights bill
isn't being sent to Congress.

695
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,432
I'm running out of ways
to explain it to Congress.

696
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:00,037
You take legislative action now,
all you'll do is fan the flames.

697
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,873
We made promises during the campaign.

698
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,191
We sit on this bill,
our supporters will never forgive us.

699
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,919
It is also the right thing to do.

700
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,914
- It's the wrong time to do it.
- The wrong time?

701
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,914
We've got kids in the street
getting their heads busted open.

702
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,436
And how does sending what will surely be...

703
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,637
...a failed bill to Congress help kids?

704
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,520
Well, burying our head in the sand
is not a solution.

705
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,514
Neither is getting your ass handed
to you by Richard Russell.

706
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,559
- I am so tired...
- Forget about the demise of the bill.

707
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,757
What do you think he'll do to your budget?

708
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,435
Do you believe
they'll hold the budget bill hostage?

709
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,240
To block civil rights,
they'll hold everything hostage.

710
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,869
- To hell with Russell. We'll go around him.
- You can't.

711
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,633
Then we'll go through him.

712
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:41,720
We've got Martin Luther King writing
letters from jail. It's an embarrassment.

713
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,998
- What are we waiting for?!
- Mr. President...

714
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:47,436
...I may not be the smartest man
in this room.

715
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:51,600
Hell, I may not be as smart
as any man in this room.

716
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,037
But I know the Congress of the United States.

717
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,352
And if you submit
this civil rights bill now...

718
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,432
...it will never become law.

719
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,036
Thank you, gentlemen.

720
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,269
- What do you think?
- The time for negotiation is over.

721
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:23,353
- What about Southern Democrats?
- You never had their support.

722
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,080
This is one of those times
to draw a line in the sand.

723
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,630
We could get to them through Lyndon.
Send a message.

724
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,269
They might listen to a Southerner
who's on our side.

725
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,711
What makes you think he's on our side?

726
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,194
Kenny...

727
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,392
...can we get this bill passed?

728
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:43,077
I don't know, sir.

729
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,431
It's not gonna be easy.

730
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:53,237
Well, we don't do these things
because they're easy.

731
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,114
We do them because they're hard.

732
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,519
What do you want me to tell Lyndon?

733
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,751
He's no longer a part of this discussion.

734
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,960
The Kennedys attended
private schools their entire lives.

735
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,351
Now they wanna talk about equality.

736
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:11,558
Voluntary integration is one thing,
but don't you think that I...

737
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:14,838
...as an American citizen,
shouldn't be forced to eat a hamburger...

738
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,232
...next to someone in a restaurant
I don't wanna bump elbows with?

739
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:21,035
Dick, I think it is unconscionable...

740
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,716
...that you, as an American citizen,
should ever...

741
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,475
...be forced to eat a hamburger.

742
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,480
Don't be a wisea... Lyndon.

743
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,678
I don't find this topic amusing.

744
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:35,275
Well, here's where I get confused.

745
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,432
A baby calf is born.

746
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:40,911
It grows into a cow,
lives on a farm, gets slaughtered...

747
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:44,198
...butchered, packaged, shipped, cooked...

748
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,317
...and finally served to you.

749
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:51,350
Most, if not all, those steps required
the hands of black men.

750
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,950
Why is it that
when it comes time to eat it...

751
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:58,273
...you can't stomach the notion of sitting
next to a black man while you chew?

752
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,233
- If those...
- May I clear your plate?

753
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:02,033
Oh, yes, Zephyr. Delicious.

754
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:04,590
"If the law can compel me to hire a negro...

755
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,638
...it can compel a negro to work for me.

756
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,918
And such a law would do nothing more
than enslave a minority."

757
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,235
And that's what one senator had to say
about civil rights legislation. Thank you.

758
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,552
That's probably Strom Thurmond.
He's an asshole and a moron.

759
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:19,393
No, it was you.

760
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:24,629
1949, your first speech
on the Senate floor. Ha.

761
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:29,073
You spoke for over an hour in opposition
to a civil rights bill just like this one.

762
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,196
I remember watching you speak,
thinking to myself:

763
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,317
"This young man's the future of the South."

764
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,476
The best leaders of the time...

765
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:43,520
...from both our states, voted for secession.

766
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:48,038
And they were great men
who nearly destroyed America.

767
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,278
I don't ever want a history book
to say that about me.

768
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,874
Mmm.

769
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,712
Let me ask you something.

770
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,510
When was the last time
you had a meal with her?

771
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,271
She's an employee...

772
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,478
...but if you think
that I would have any objection...

773
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,553
...of breaking bread with her,
then you are a fool.

774
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,638
So you're telling me she's your equal?

775
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:18,160
That woman spends more time in
this house than anyone except Lady Bird.

776
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,312
She is family.

777
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,557
I don't know how I missed the resemblance.

778
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,913
Look, what I'm talking about here is freedom.

779
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,756
I'm talking about the preservation
of a way of life.

780
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:33,516
A way of life
that you and I both grew up with.

781
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,194
There's nothing wrong with that.

782
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,109
Then why are we whispering?

783
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:43,398
<i>One hundred years of delay have passed...</i>

784
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,711
<i>...since President Lincoln freed the slaves.</i>

785
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:49,909
<i>Yet their heirs, their grandsons,
are not fully free.</i>

786
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,271
<i>They are not yet freed
from the bonds of injustice.</i>

787
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:57,672
<i>They are not yet freed from social
and economic oppression.</i>

788
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,560
<i>And this nation...</i>

789
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:03,077
<i>...for all its hopes and all its boasts...</i>

790
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:07,280
<i>...will not be fully free
until all its citizens are free.</i>

791
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:11,072
<i>Next week, I shall ask the Congress
of the United States to act...</i>

792
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,318
<i>...to make a commitment
it has not fully made in this century...</i>

793
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,358
<i>...to the proposition that race...</i>

794
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:20,196
<i>...has no place in American life or law.</i>

795
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:26,319
Good morning, Mrs. Lincoln.
I'd like a moment with the president.

796
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:32,675
Sir, Vice President Johnson is here.
What shall I tell him?

797
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,273
You can go in.

798
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,079
Thank you.

799
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,800
Good morning, Mr. President.

800
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,919
- How you getting along?
- You're up early, Lyndon.

801
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:55,320
No, the president hasn't arrived yet,
but what do you need?

802
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:00,397
It can wait.

803
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:02,559
What's on your mind?

804
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:11,035
I wanna know
the president's intentions for '64.

805
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:14,951
Does he wanna keep me on the ticket?

806
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:19,192
Dropping you from the ticket
would be more trouble than it's worth.

807
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,511
Now, if you'll excuse me, I was on my way.

808
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,356
Bobby.

809
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,113
Why don't you like me?

810
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:32,834
Your brother likes me.

811
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,673
Your father likes me.

812
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,230
What is it makes you hate me so much?

813
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,959
I don't hate you. I just... I...

814
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:43,072
We see the world in very different ways.

815
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:46,797
Then why do you keep me around?

816
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,356
I was in Congress 24 years...

817
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:53,355
...but you never asked for my help
in legislative issues.

818
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,159
I'm from the South...

819
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:58,757
...but when you need help down there,
you go to other Southerners.

820
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:01,310
Why don't you just...

821
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,073
...put me out to pasture?

822
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:07,917
You've worked overtime
making sure I'm politically through.

823
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:11,517
I can never run for elected office again.

824
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:16,630
Hell, I don't even know
if I can help the president out in '64.

825
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:26,672
This isn't about '64, is it?

826
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:31,391
It's about '68.

827
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:36,639
You don't wanna bring in someone new.
You keep me here precisely because...

828
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:40,516
...you've made me politically irrelevant.

829
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:44,235
That way, in '68...

830
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:51,480
...the vice president isn't
the presumptive nominee.

831
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:53,438
You are.

832
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,271
You think I'd be that calculating?

833
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:00,271
I know I would be.

834
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:30,195
If either of you get a better job offer,
I suggest you take it.

835
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:33,034
My future is behind me.

836
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:57,634
He's gone.

837
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:21,119
Mr. President?

838
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:46,317
Sir, I need to announce
the death of President Kennedy.

839
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:50,839
Ahem. I want you to hold off
on that, Malcolm.

840
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,596
Rufus, get some cars set up and let
the drivers know we're ready to move.

841
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:58,720
Emery, have your people
locate Luci and Lynda Bird.

842
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:01,759
I want my daughters to meet us
when we arrive in Washington.

843
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:06,517
Also, have McNamara, Rusk and the rest
of the cabinet on the ground at Andrews.

844
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,990
Rusk and five cabinet members
are on a plane to Japan.

845
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,192
Turn it around.

846
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:14,034
I need you to tell Mrs. Kennedy
it's time to go.

847
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:15,919
Mrs. Kennedy won't leave without the body.

848
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:18,595
Well, we won't leave here
without Mrs. Kennedy.

849
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:21,832
- Sir, we need to get you in the air.
- Not without Jackie.

850
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,720
- Then let's wait for her at the plane.
- Fine.

851
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:27,270
Cliff, I need people I know close by.

852
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:30,874
Congressmen, I want you
flying back to Washington with me.

853
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,759
- Yes, sir.
- Sir...

854
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:36,596
...the American people need to know
that President Kennedy has died.

855
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,031
On April 14th, 1865...

856
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:45,477
...two men attempted to kill
Secretary of State William Seward...

857
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,711
...stabbing him in his home.

858
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:50,270
At the same time,
another assassin was on his way...

859
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:53,638
...to take the life
of Vice President Andrew Johnson.

860
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,917
This was the same night...

861
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:58,470
...that John Wilkes Booth
shot Abraham Lincoln.

862
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:03,840
We don't know the extent
of this conspiracy or who's behind it.

863
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,720
Malcolm, you're to announce
President Kennedy's death...

864
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,714
...only after the rest of us
are safely onboard that plane.

865
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:12,270
Otherwise, you're gonna make
these boys' jobs...

866
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:14,636
- ...a whole hell of a lot harder.
- Sir.

867
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:36,156
<i>It was only on October the 24th...</i>

868
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:39,518
<i>...that our ambassador
to the United Nations, Adlai Stevenson...</i>

869
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:43,674
<i>...was assaulted in Dallas,
leaving a dinner meeting there.</i>

870
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:49,831
<i>From Dallas, Texas,
the flash, apparently official...</i>

871
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,995
<i>...President Kennedy died
at 1 p.m. Central Standard Time...</i>

872
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:58,752
<i>...2 o'clock Eastern Standard Time...</i>

873
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,515
<i>...some 38 minutes ago.</i>

874
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:10,273
<i>Vice President Lyndon Johnson
has left the hospital in Dallas...</i>

875
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:13,990
<i>...but we do not know
to where he has proceeded.</i>

876
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:17,830
<i>Presumably, he will be taking
the oath of office shortly...</i>

877
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:23,195
<i>...and become the 36th president
of the United States.</i>

878
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:26,400
I wanna thank everybody
for getting here so quickly.

879
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:30,793
And I'm gonna need your help
back in Washington.

880
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,475
- Marie, can you join me in the next room?
- Yes, sir.

881
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,160
- Excuse me.
- <i>At Dallas Airport...</i>

882
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:38,313
<i>...was cheerful, waving...</i>

883
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,351
This is Lyndon Johnson.

884
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,120
Yeah.

885
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,076
I need you to take notes.

886
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,949
Sir, I got Lyndon Johnson on the phone.

887
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:19,996
Hello, Lyndon.

888
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:23,430
Bobby, I am...

889
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:26,320
...so sorry for your loss.

890
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,633
Words cannot express...

891
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:31,269
The whole country mourns with you.

892
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:34,551
- Thank you.
- <i>Listen, Bobby...</i>

893
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:37,713
...I need your opinion about something.

894
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:40,520
People down here are saying that I...

895
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:44,356
I should take the oath of office
as soon as possible...

896
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,672
<i>...before we depart.</i>

897
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,111
What do you think about that?

898
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:52,795
Well, I think it would be nice
for President Kennedy...

899
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,917
...to return to Washington as president.

900
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:59,390
Well, I understand that. I do.

901
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:03,310
But we got confusion down here,
and it's liable to turn into panic.

902
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:06,672
I think it would put
a lot of people at ease...

903
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:11,551
...if I was to take the oath right now.

904
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:14,950
What's the matter?
You afraid you'll arrive...

905
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:17,038
...and the White House won't be here?

906
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:20,600
I think it's important
that the world knows...

907
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:25,357
...that the American government is
functioning and someone's in charge.

908
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:27,591
Well, I don't know what the hurry is...

909
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:30,719
...but if you're so insistent
on taking the oath, take the oath.

910
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:34,193
Okay, Bobby, then I'll take the oath.

911
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:35,396
Fine, Lyndon.

912
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:38,200
<i>Now, we have to be absolutely certain that...</i>

913
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:39,760
...we do this the right way.

914
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:43,152
So I need you to get me the precise wording.

915
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:46,878
- Is that all?
- <i>One last thing.</i>

916
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,759
Who do we need to administer it?

917
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:50,435
Any judge can do it.

918
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:52,718
Okay, well, thank you, Bobby.

919
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,599
God bless.

920
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:57,394
Get me Sarah Hughes.

921
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:01,398
I do solemnly swear...

922
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:05,998
That I will faithfully execute...

923
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,436
The office of president
of the United States...

924
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:11,350
The office of president
of the United States...

925
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:17,391
And will, to the best of my ability...

926
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:20,029
- Preserve, protect...
- Preserve, protect...

927
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,078
- And defend...
- And defend...

928
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:25,199
The Constitution of the United States.

929
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:28,910
- The Constitution of the United States.
- So help me God.

930
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:31,997
So help me God.

931
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:38,710
<i>At 3:39 p.m., the machinery
of our government...</i>

932
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:41,952
<i>...conferred the unique powers
and awesome responsibilities...</i>

933
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:45,676
<i>...of the presidency
upon Lyndon Baines Johnson.</i>

934
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:50,232
<i>There is, in the urgent necessity
of this continuity of presidential power...</i>

935
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,040
<i>...a reassurance
that the government will function...</i>

936
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:56,796
<i>...the nation endure,
no matter how great the tragedy...</i>

937
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,872
<i>...no matter how grievous the shock.</i>

938
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:00,394
Welcome back, sir.

939
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:02,995
- Mrs. Johnson.
- Glad you're safe, sir.

940
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:06,278
Early reports said you'd been shot
or that you'd had a heart attack.

941
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,040
Agent Youngblood took excellent care of us.

942
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:10,236
- Bird?
- Yes?

943
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:14,150
Can you get your good stationery? I'd like
to write letters to Caroline and John.

944
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:15,635
- Juanita.
- Yes, sir?

945
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:18,634
- Come with me. I need to make calls.
- Yes, sir.

946
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:22,909
Yes, it has been a shocking day.

947
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,952
Well, I...

948
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:29,913
You know, I feel inadequate to the task.

949
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:33,994
And I'm gonna be relying
on your good, sound judgment.

950
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:35,640
And...

951
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,711
I'll be calling on you...

952
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:44,190
...to get your advice.

953
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:48,240
You know how much
I've admired you over the years.

954
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:52,236
Well, please give my love to Mrs. Eisenhower.

955
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:53,510
No, no, no.

956
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:57,037
Anything Harry Truman has to say,
I'm all ears.

957
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,840
I'm gonna be calling on you real soon.

958
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,357
J. Edgar, you are not just
the head of the Federal Bureau...

959
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:05,830
...you're as close as "close" can be to me.

960
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,517
Now, let's just try to put
our country at close ranks...

961
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:15,436
...and pull ourselves out of this
terrible situation we find ourselves in.

962
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:18,991
Nellie, how's our boy?
Is he in a lot of pain?

963
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,238
Well, tell John I'm praying for him...

964
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:25,235
...and Bird and I are sending you both
a big hug and a kiss.

965
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:28,313
Pierre, it makes no sense
to be jumping ship now...

966
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:30,557
...when we're all on the same fucking ocean.

967
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,473
I'm going to bed, dear.

968
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:33,915
Okay, baby.

969
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:37,312
Now, I need you now more than he ever did.

970
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,710
<i>Lady Bird and I will remain
at the Elms for the foreseeable future.</i>

971
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:44,839
<i>And Jackie can stay at the White House
for as long as she likes.</i>

972
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,630
<i>Bundy said you and your staff should
move to the Oval Office tomorrow.</i>

973
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,280
<i>Fine.</i>

974
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:52,159
Ted Sorensen?

975
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:53,959
It's Lyndon Johnson.

976
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:56,360
Hello, Mr. President.

977
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:58,034
I'm glad I tracked you down.

978
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:01,238
Sir, Senator Russell's
pulled up to the house.

979
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:06,391
Listen, I know how much
you loved President Kennedy.

980
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:08,560
<i>And he loved you too.</i>

981
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:11,554
<i>You were a trusted servant, loyal to the end.</i>

982
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,835
Ted, I need you now more than he ever did.

983
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,196
How many senators did Russell bring with him?

984
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:21,437
Looks like the entire Southern delegation.

985
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,000
Any idea what they want?

986
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:25,669
Russell said they just wanted
to wish you well.

987
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:28,958
No. They could've done that over the phone.

988
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:39,952
Mr. President.

989
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:44,193
Mr. President.

990
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:47,157
In this dark hour of our nation's history...

991
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:49,915
...we must remember
to give thanks for our blessings.

992
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:56,275
Because out of the despicable ashes
of a presidential assassination...

993
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:01,474
...a new leader has emerged.

994
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:04,678
And we're all here to offer our support.

995
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:06,194
Yes, sir.

996
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:11,071
After a century of persecution,
a century of being treated as inferior...

997
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:14,039
...after 100 long years...

998
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:16,715
...we finally have one of our own
leading this nation.

999
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:21,319
America has a Southern president.

1000
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:25,952
And we could think
of no finer representative for our people.

1001
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:29,876
Dear Lord...

1002
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:34,312
...continue to watch over our president...

1003
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:37,558
...and fill him with the strength...

1004
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:41,839
...and wisdom as he works to do
the same for all your children.

1005
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:44,433
- Amen.
- Amen.

1006
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:48,918
Thank you, Dick. Gentlemen.

1007
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:57,114
Good morning, gentlemen.

1008
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:58,714
- Mr. President.
- Mr. President.

1009
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:01,389
I'm pleased to see you back at work already.

1010
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:05,590
The Constitution put me in the White House...

1011
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:10,079
...but there's no law
to make you stay here with me.

1012
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:15,640
Now, I know you loved President Kennedy...

1013
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:19,635
...but I need you now more than he ever did.

1014
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:23,234
Not that I loved Caesar less...

1015
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:26,080
...but that I loved Rome more.

1016
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:36,196
- I can't believe he quoted Shakespeare.
- Can't believe he quoted Brutus.

1017
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,514
Good morning, Mrs. Lincoln.

1018
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:40,599
Good morning.

1019
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:44,235
Now, I have an 11:30 appointment.

1020
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,790
Can I get my girls in the office by then?

1021
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:50,072
I'll do the best I can.

1022
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:54,392
I know you will.

1023
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:16,149
Mrs. Kennedy had the new carpet installed...

1024
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:17,640
...when everybody went to Texas.

1025
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:22,120
Oh. Strange choice.

1026
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:27,472
What's going on?

1027
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:35,720
Mr. Johnson told me
to clear everything out immediately.

1028
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:42,830
You don't waste any time, do you, Lyndon?

1029
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,435
- Excuse me?
- It's going to take some doing to get...

1030
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:48,877
...all of President Kennedy's
belongings packed and relocated.

1031
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:51,637
I was told to use this office.

1032
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:54,634
Just like you were told
to take the oath in Dallas?

1033
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:57,720
Bobby...

1034
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:00,236
...I'm not trying to shove myself anywhere.

1035
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:04,474
In fact, I told Jackie she could stay
in the East Wing as long as she needs.

1036
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:08,520
Well, that's not really the part of the
building that you're interested in, is it?

1037
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:11,555
I'm just trying to do my job.

1038
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:16,153
My brother's coffin is down the hall.
This is not where our attention should be.

1039
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:23,957
We all mourn for your brother.

1040
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:27,591
But somebody has to tend
to the business of the country.

1041
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:30,673
Mourning for my brother is
the business of the country.

1042
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:35,750
We can come back later
after my cabinet meeting.

1043
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:38,232
Your cabinet...

1044
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:47,519
Bobby...

1045
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,876
...I know you've got a lot on your mind.

1046
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:54,112
But I want you to stand with me
as attorney general.

1047
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:58,116
You've already got one photograph
with a grieving Kennedy at your side.

1048
01:05:58,280 --> 01:05:59,714
Do you really need another?

1049
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:07,200
I'd appreciate it if you kept me
apprised of any...

1050
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:08,993
...change in plans you might have.

1051
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:10,674
Okay.

1052
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:12,593
Yeah, I know where to find you.

1053
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:32,832
<i>People gathered outside the grounds
of the White House today...</i>

1054
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,357
<i>...watching the dignitaries
and government officials...</i>

1055
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:38,716
<i>...and representatives
of foreign governments...</i>

1056
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:41,998
<i>...come through the gates
and go to pay last respects...</i>

1057
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:46,040
<i>...to President Kennedy, lying in
the East Room of the White House.</i>

1058
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:50,274
<i>Our reporter, David Schumacher,
was outside the White House...</i>

1059
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:54,156
<i>...and talked to some of those people.
Let's look at that film now.</i>

1060
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:59,389
<i>Just words... Just... I just can't describe
just how I feel at this time.</i>

1061
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:00,960
<i>It just seems empty.</i>

1062
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:05,518
<i>It just doesn't seem like anybody else
could fill the place the way he did.</i>

1063
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:08,156
Sir, we need to discuss
your address to Congress.

1064
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:10,391
<i>It's unreal. This can't
happen in our country.</i>

1065
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:13,075
<i>I feel the profound grief that...</i>

1066
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:15,755
I'm not ready for that yet.

1067
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:19,520
Well, with all due respect,
you better get ready.

1068
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:22,189
President Kennedy's burial
has been set for Monday.

1069
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:25,034
Thursday being Thanksgiving,
we don't have much of a window.

1070
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:29,831
<i>Thinking that, possibly,
the only thing we could do is to...</i>

1071
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,789
<i>...pray that Lyndon Johnson can carry on.</i>

1072
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:38,998
Johnson gave Pierre the "I need
you more than he needed you" speech.

1073
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:40,236
What did you tell him?

1074
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:43,359
I told him I'd stay as press secretary
as long as he needed me.

1075
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:44,910
Till Tuesday.

1076
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:49,757
Johnson's not gonna be satisfied till
every one of us promises to serve him.

1077
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:51,519
So, what are we doing here?

1078
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:54,877
<i>In his inaugural address...</i>

1079
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:56,997
<i>...President Kennedy declared that...</i>

1080
01:07:57,160 --> 01:08:01,120
<i>...the torch had been passed
to a new generation of Americans.</i>

1081
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:03,511
The question before us now is:

1082
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:05,837
Who should be the custodian of that torch?

1083
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:09,835
<i>The Constitution may say
that the vice president...</i>

1084
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:14,233
<i>...is the next in the line of succession,
but does anyone here believe...</i>

1085
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:18,320
...that Lyndon Johnson is
the man to carry that torch?

1086
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:20,832
<i>So, what are you suggesting?</i>

1087
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,515
<i>I didn't come to Washington
just to work for John Kennedy.</i>

1088
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:26,959
I came here to work
for what John Kennedy believed in.

1089
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:29,673
<i>There is unfinished business.</i>

1090
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:33,238
<i>Right now our only hope of completing it
is by serving his successor.</i>

1091
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:35,198
<i>That's not true. There are other ways.</i>

1092
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:37,511
<i>We've come too far to put everything on hold.</i>

1093
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:41,356
So you think that Johnson will continue
the work of President Kennedy?

1094
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:45,920
<i>This is a man who has fought against
every piece of civil rights legislation...</i>

1095
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,356
<i>...for the last 20 years.</i>

1096
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:50,677
How do you honor Kennedy
by working for Johnson?

1097
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:52,115
You're looking at it wrong.

1098
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:56,160
Even if Johnson believed in what
we believe in, and that is up for debate...

1099
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:58,397
<i>...how much do you think
he'd accomplish in one year?</i>

1100
01:08:58,560 --> 01:08:59,630
<i>Good point.</i>

1101
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:01,678
<i>Could we mount a campaign by then?</i>

1102
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:05,277
<i>Bobby is more powerful and more
popular than any other Democrat...</i>

1103
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:07,079
<i>...including Lyndon Johnson.</i>

1104
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:10,711
The men in this room all want to see
a president, a President Kennedy...

1105
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:14,351
...deliver this world to a better place.
So do the people of this country.

1106
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:15,510
<i>Hear, hear.</i>

1107
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:18,354
<i>What are you asking us to do? Quit?</i>

1108
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:20,273
- <i>Betray Lyndon Johnson?</i>
- <i>No.</i>

1109
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:22,955
<i>No, no, no. No one is being asked
to sabotage anything.</i>

1110
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:27,160
<i>No one is calling for a mass exodus,
and this certainly is not a coup d'Г©tat.</i>

1111
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:31,520
<i>Johnson needs to make his case
to the American people.</i>

1112
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:34,240
He needs to prove
that he's worthy of this job.

1113
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:36,750
And if he stumbles...

1114
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:39,560
...if he should fall...

1115
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:43,429
...we need to be prepared to challenge him.

1116
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:46,439
<i>And it will be Bobby's time.</i>

1117
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:56,160
We can't just sweep the rest
of the agenda under the rug.

1118
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:59,438
Yes. He has to make
some progress on civil rights.

1119
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:02,593
- Some. We need to be realistic.
- Howdy, Zephyr.

1120
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:04,598
- Evening, sir.
- Good evening, sir.

1121
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:07,759
Hear anything back from the Kennedy men?

1122
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:10,719
Well, two nights ago, they had a meeting...

1123
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:15,272
...and I... I think we're gonna
hear something soon.

1124
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:17,951
How they going in there?

1125
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,553
It's going.

1126
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:23,155
We can't just keep doing the same thing.

1127
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:26,239
The best thing we can do is show
some progress in civil rights.

1128
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:28,392
"Some progress" is not enough.

1129
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:31,553
The civil rights bill was the cornerstone
of Kennedy's presidency.

1130
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:33,632
Even Kennedy was gonna have to compromise.

1131
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:35,120
Exactly.

1132
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:38,239
And nobody expects Johnson
to be John Kennedy.

1133
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:33,393
Do our daughters know I love them?

1134
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:36,874
Of course they do, Lyndon. Why?

1135
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:41,476
I didn't always know.

1136
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:44,310
Rebekah loved you.

1137
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:49,510
Some days, she...

1138
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:54,671
...made me feel like a prince, but...

1139
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:59,277
...some days...

1140
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:03,719
Lyndon.

1141
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,149
Honey?

1142
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:07,915
You're not supposed to have that.

1143
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:16,115
Now, what's this all about?

1144
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:23,951
From the time I was a boy, I...

1145
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:26,555
I had this dream...

1146
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:35,638
I'd rather not have it than have it this way.

1147
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:39,913
Oh, my poor darling.

1148
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:48,759
They don't... They want...

1149
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:51,718
They want Jack. They love Jack.

1150
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:54,679
They love Bobby. They...

1151
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:58,630
They don't even like me.

1152
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:08,913
Lyndon...

1153
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:13,877
...your mother didn't turn her back on you
because she didn't love you.

1154
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:18,954
She just couldn't stand to see you
when you weren't at your best.

1155
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:24,514
She wouldn't wanna see me now.

1156
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:39,395
You're gonna be all right.

1157
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:43,276
You're a good man in a tight spot.

1158
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:48,679
President Kennedy did
wonderful things for America.

1159
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:54,234
Not the least of which was choosing you
to be his successor.

1160
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:59,792
He was a man of great ideas.

1161
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:03,319
Now the country needs a man...

1162
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:05,597
...who can deliver.

1163
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:15,079
<i>If we don't do anything about civil rights...</i>

1164
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:17,835
...we'll face a challenge at the convention.

1165
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,992
- From Bobby?
- From someone.

1166
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:21,389
The question is:

1167
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:24,957
What's the minimum we need
to accomplish in order to win reelection?

1168
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:28,192
Which provisions in Kennedy's bill
can we live without?

1169
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:30,756
Are you saying weaken the bill
right out of the gate?

1170
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:33,958
We can't risk everything
chasing ambitious goals.

1171
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:36,191
Then what the hell's the presidency for?

1172
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:40,996
Sit.

1173
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:45,318
It can't be about a shiny airplane
or a room with no corners.

1174
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:49,030
Surely, we can aspire to something greater.

1175
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:51,431
You wanna back Kennedy's civil rights bill?

1176
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:54,115
The entire goddamn thing.

1177
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:56,877
Are you even in favor of it?

1178
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:03,959
You know, about a...

1179
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:06,278
...year ago...

1180
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:10,440
...my private cook Mrs. Wright,
who you know...

1181
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:14,594
...was driving from here
down to the ranch in Texas.

1182
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:17,832
So I asked her if she would mind...

1183
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,357
...bringing my dog,
Little Beagle Johnson, with her...

1184
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:25,710
...in order that he could be there
when I got home.

1185
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:29,635
Mrs. Wright respectfully declined.

1186
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:31,757
She said it is hard enough...

1187
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:34,873
...for a black woman driving
through the South...

1188
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:37,430
...without having a dog to worry about.

1189
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:42,313
Finding a place to eat,
to sleep, to use the restroom.

1190
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:47,760
The personal cook of the vice president
of the United States...

1191
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:51,311
...has to drive through towns
without stopping...

1192
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:55,230
...then squat to pee by the side of the road.

1193
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:58,677
Hundred years ago, she would've been a slave.

1194
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:03,551
Hundred years from now, hell,
she might be president.

1195
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:06,758
But today...

1196
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:11,794
...we live in a time of too much uncertainty.

1197
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,720
Where can she eat? Where can she sleep?

1198
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:16,036
Can she vote?

1199
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:19,238
And if she does, will she be harassed
for casting that vote?

1200
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:22,359
Can she attend school? If so, which school?

1201
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:26,560
Can she travel the cities
and towns of this land...

1202
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:30,236
...without fearing for her safety?

1203
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:35,832
What rights that belong
to the men in this room...

1204
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,515
...should not be afforded to her?

1205
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:42,469
Sir, you're gonna lose the support of
the people who've always had your back.

1206
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:46,998
And if you aren't successful, you're never
gonna earn the support of anyone else.

1207
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:51,240
Four other presidents have fought
Congress on this and failed.

1208
01:16:57,240 --> 01:16:59,994
There will be no compromise.

1209
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:02,595
There will be no negotiation.

1210
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:05,713
And there will be no failure.

1211
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:08,679
This time,
Congress is not fighting a president.

1212
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:10,672
It's fighting two.

1213
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:14,038
Never underestimate
the intensity of a martyr's cause...

1214
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:19,594
...or the size of a Texan's balls.

1215
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:30,600
Good morning, Mr. President.

1216
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:33,157
Good morning, Juanita.

1217
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:57,077
Ted, we have scheduled a speech before
a joint session of Congress tomorrow.

1218
01:18:57,760 --> 01:18:59,160
I've heard.

1219
01:18:59,320 --> 01:19:01,039
I'd like you to write it.

1220
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:02,429
Mr. President...

1221
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:05,799
...I don't know
that I'll be coming back to work.

1222
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:15,434
Ted...

1223
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:23,073
...the voice of John Kennedy rings
throughout our land.

1224
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:26,870
You gave words to that voice.

1225
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:29,032
I need those words now.

1226
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:30,756
Mr. President, I...

1227
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:34,914
We are moving ahead full tilt
with his civil rights bill.

1228
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:37,760
His entire agenda.

1229
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:42,159
This is about making
President Kennedy's vision...

1230
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:44,039
...a reality.

1231
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:53,277
Just checking to see if you need anything.

1232
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:55,636
I don't understand what you want this to be.

1233
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:57,280
Is it supposed to be a speech...

1234
01:19:57,480 --> 01:19:58,994
- ...or a eulogy...?
- Both.

1235
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:01,670
A country's final goodbye
to President Kennedy...

1236
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:04,400
...and its first introduction
to President Johnson.

1237
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:06,552
It's a eulogy, it's an opening statement...

1238
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:09,872
...it's a State of the Union,
it's an inaugural address.

1239
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:12,874
And you have less than 21 hours to write it.

1240
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:16,831
Do you really believe
he can accomplish all this?

1241
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:18,550
I do.

1242
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:20,120
How can he?

1243
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:22,351
The same way he always has.

1244
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:27,470
You are as worthless as porkless pig.
Now get me the goddamn list!

1245
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:30,235
Senator Dirksen's office said he can stop by.

1246
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:32,471
- I'll go to him.
- Mr. President...

1247
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:34,717
...I need to know your thinking on Vietnam.

1248
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:38,157
My thinking on Vietnam is that
I don't wanna think about Vietnam.

1249
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:43,316
You stayed on the line to wait for me
to hang up on you?

1250
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:47,717
- Rusk needs 10 minutes.
- He can have them in 20.

1251
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:50,839
- There's gonna be a Southern filibuster.
- What's the count on cloture?

1252
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,879
- About 56.
- You can leave about now.

1253
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:57,074
Trust me, Bob.

1254
01:20:57,240 --> 01:21:02,634
I am not gonna be the president to let
Southeast Asia fall to the communists.

1255
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:06,157
When I ask for a number,
I need a goddamn number.

1256
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:10,553
Senator Dirksen,
this civil rights bill will have its day.

1257
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:12,797
Oh, it's gonna have more than its day, sir.

1258
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:15,350
There's going to be all-out war,
and I need men.

1259
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,910
Men with principle.

1260
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:20,914
Because the Southerners in my party,
most of them anyway...

1261
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:23,675
...are gonna rise up against us.

1262
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:26,514
Now, Senator Yarborough, are you up for that?

1263
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:30,151
It is my sincere hope that the Republicans...

1264
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:32,511
...the party of Lincoln...

1265
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:34,478
...fire the final shot.

1266
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:36,916
Sir, I serve at your pleasure.

1267
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:39,520
Good.

1268
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:57,396
This is your fucking mess I'm cleaning up.

1269
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:04,997
Good to see you, Dick.

1270
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:08,032
How you getting along?

1271
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:11,831
Why don't we have a drink?

1272
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:14,953
No.

1273
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:17,954
No, I... I think I'm done drinking with you.

1274
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:22,754
You hurt the very people
who made you who you are.

1275
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:24,718
And for what?

1276
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:28,637
Civil rights is an idea whose time has come.

1277
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:30,871
This will define your presidency.

1278
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:34,157
I can only hope.

1279
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:38,510
You're willing to hitch your wagon
to the outcome of this bill?

1280
01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:44,030
We've been talking about this forever,
and we never say a damn thing.

1281
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:46,431
Well... What...? What do you wanna say?

1282
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:48,398
That you're gonna turn your back on me?

1283
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:50,950
That you don't care about
everything I've done for you?

1284
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:55,478
- That you're willing to betray me?
- That you're a racist.

1285
01:22:57,080 --> 01:23:01,836
All your talk about the Southern way of
life and loving the negra as your brother...

1286
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:06,711
...and all the while, you plot against him
like he is a sworn enemy.

1287
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,553
I don't care where we're standing.

1288
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:10,791
No man is gonna talk to me like that.

1289
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,231
You are a good man, Dick.

1290
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:14,800
World-class.

1291
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:18,112
I admire you more than any man alive.

1292
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:21,159
But you are wrong on this.
You are just plain wrong.

1293
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:25,637
I'm gonna fight you
with everything that I have.

1294
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:27,871
Fine. Fight me.

1295
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:29,520
But not in here.

1296
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:33,469
And not in backrooms in hushed conversation.

1297
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:36,075
Fight me on the floor
of the United States Senate...

1298
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:38,317
...in front of the entire world.

1299
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:40,437
And on that battlefield...

1300
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:43,718
...let each man write his own legacy.

1301
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:08,236
Time to go.

1302
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:39,477
Try not to look at the Southern Caucus
when talking about civil rights.

1303
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:41,438
How will he know where they're sitting?

1304
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,000
Don't worry. I'll spot them.

1305
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:45,755
They'll be the ones not clapping.

1306
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:59,392
Are you ready, sir?

1307
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,514
Yes.

1308
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:12,152
Mr. Speaker.

1309
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:15,597
The president of the United States.

1310
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:36,397
Mr. President.

1311
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:55,754
Good, Mr. President.

1312
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:57,839
Mr. President.

1313
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:08,834
Mr. Speaker.

1314
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,957
Mr. President.

1315
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:14,080
Members of the House,
Members of the Senate...

1316
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:16,756
...my fellow Americans.

1317
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:20,431
All I have...

1318
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:26,519
...I would have given gladly
not to be standing here today.

1319
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,959
The greatest leader of our time...

1320
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:33,311
...has been struck down...

1321
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:37,315
...by the foulest deed of our time.

1322
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:39,558
Today...

1323
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:43,191
...John Fitzgerald Kennedy lives on.

1324
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:48,313
He lives on in the mind
and memories of mankind.

1325
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:53,199
He lives on in the hearts of his countrymen.

1326
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:57,590
No words are sad enough...

1327
01:26:58,200 --> 01:27:01,238
...to express our sense of loss.

1328
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:04,831
No words are strong enough...

1329
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:08,232
...to express our determination...

1330
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:10,232
...to continue...

1331
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:12,676
...the forward thrust...

1332
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:15,674
...of America that he began.

1333
01:27:16,720 --> 01:27:21,397
An assassin's bullet has thrust upon me...

1334
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:24,553
...the awesome burden of the presidency.

1335
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:27,916
And in this critical moment...

1336
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:29,753
...it is our duty...

1337
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:32,389
...yours and mine...

1338
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:35,035
...as the government of the United States...

1339
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:40,320
...to do away with uncertainty
and doubt and delay...

1340
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:45,117
...and to show that we are capable
of decisive action.

1341
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:49,400
That from the brutal loss of our leader...

1342
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:53,351
...we will derive not weakness...

1343
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:55,034
...but strength.

1344
01:27:55,440 --> 01:28:01,072
John Kennedy's death commands
what his life conveyed:

1345
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:05,154
That America must move forward.

1346
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:07,960
The time has come...

1347
01:28:08,120 --> 01:28:12,160
...for Americans of all races and creeds...

1348
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:14,797
...and political beliefs...

1349
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:17,156
...to understand...

1350
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:19,391
...and to respect one another.

1351
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:22,315
So let us put an end to the teaching...

1352
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:26,992
...and the preaching of hate and evil...

1353
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:29,277
...and violence.

1354
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:32,275
I profoundly hope...

1355
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:37,231
...that the tragedy and the torment
of these terrible days...

1356
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:40,871
...will bind us together in new fellowship...

1357
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:45,757
...making us one people
in our hour of sorrow.

1358
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:48,953
So let us, here, highly resolve...

1359
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:52,397
...that John Fitzgerald Kennedy
did not live...

1360
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:55,917
...or die in vain.

1361
01:28:56,480 --> 01:29:01,555
No memorial oration or eulogy
could more eloquently honor...

1362
01:29:01,720 --> 01:29:04,030
...President Kennedy's memory...

1363
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:08,797
...than the earliest possible passage
of the civil rights bill...

1364
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:11,429
...for which he fought so long.

1365
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:18,350
We have talked long enough
in this country about equal rights.

1366
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:22,594
We have talked for 100 years or more.

1367
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:26,830
It is time now to write the next chapter...

1368
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,595
...and to write it in the books of law.

1369
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:44,357
On the 20th day of January, in 19 and 61...

1370
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:48,351
...John F. Kennedy told his countrymen...

1371
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:50,796
...that our national work...

1372
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:55,000
...would not be finished
in the first thousand days...

1373
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:57,795
...nor in the life of this administration.

1374
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:03,153
Nor even perhaps
in our lifetime on this planet.

1375
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:05,516
But he said:

1376
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:08,071
"Let us begin."

1377
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:09,914
Today...

1378
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:13,198
...in this moment of new resolve...

1379
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:16,432
...I would say to all my fellow Americans:

1380
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:20,352
Let us continue.

1381
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:56,518
Sir, we need to move beyond
civil rights and start thinking about...

1382
01:30:56,720 --> 01:30:59,315
...whatever else it is that we aim to do.

1383
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:02,713
Well, if we've learned anything
from President Kennedy...

1384
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:07,557
...it's that life is precious
and time is fleeting.

1385
01:31:07,720 --> 01:31:10,599
And I don't intend to waste either.

1386
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:14,955
Mistakes will be made,
but inaction won't be one of them.

1387
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:18,718
John Kennedy gave people hope.

1388
01:31:19,160 --> 01:31:23,200
Now we are gonna give them results.

1389
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:26,358
Let's get to work.

1390
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:29,110
- Thank you, Mr. President.
- Thank you.

1391
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:33,240
Sir, I have the request from McNamara.
Can I get your signature right there?

1392
01:31:37,320 --> 01:31:40,313
Excuse me, Mr. President.
This is the brief...
